# GUI Databases Project (PyQt6)

Project for my college course.

## Installation

1. Ensure [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is installed (either via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```shell
poetry --version
```

2. Clone this repo (or download and extract the zip/tarball)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/gui-databases
cd gui-databases
```

3. Install the required dependencies

```shell
poetry install
```

## Usage

```shell
poetry run python3 gui_databases/main.py
```

### Troubleshooting

If you receive a `ModuleNotFound` error when running (mainly occurs on Windows), then switch `python3` for `python`:

```shell
poetry run python gui_databases/main.py
```
